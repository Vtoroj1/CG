# 🌋 Vulkan Starter App

## Getting started

You need C++ compiler, Vulkan SDK and CMake installed before you can build this project.

This project uses C++20 standard and thus requires either of those compilers:
- GCC 10.X
- Clang 10
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

This is officially tested on *Windows* and *GNU/Linux platforms*, no *macOS* support yet.
If you have a working macOS solution of this code, consider submitting a PR so others
can build this example code without a hassle!

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vladeemerr/vulkan-starter-app`

This repository does not contain any submodules, it utilizes CMake's `FetchContent` feature instead.

<ins>**2. Configuring the project**</ins>

Run either one of the CMake lines to download dependencies and configure the project:

```bash
cmake --preset debug       # for GNU/Linux (GCC/Clang)
cmake --preset msvc-debug  # for Windows (Visual Studio 2019)
cmake --preset mingw-debug # for Windows (MinGW)
```

If you wish to build in `release` mode, change `debug` to `release`.

If changes are made (added/removed files), or if you want to regenerate project files, rerun the command above.

<ins>**3. Building**</ins>

To build the project, use the line below. You are most likely using `debug` preset, so
the directory that will eventually contain your build files is named `build-debug`.

Likewise for `release` that directory will be named `build-release`

Run one those commands, depending on which preset you chose:

```bash
cmake --build build-debug --parallel # for debug
cmake --build build-release --parallel # for release
```

### Running

`build-*` directory will contain the executable in one of the subdirectories after successful build.

For `msvc-{debug|release}` builds output subdirectory is set to `Debug` or `Release` respectively.
For other configurations output subdirectory is set to `vulkan-starter-app`.

**Make sure your working directory is set to the project root!**
Project root is where this README file resides. Otherwise, the
code responsible for loading shaders or other resources from files will fail,
because relative paths are used.

### Compiling shaders

`CMakeLists.txt` has a build recipe for compiling shader files
along with an application. Look for a comment in this file to see
how to compile your shaders.
